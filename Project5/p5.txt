turnin code: py_p5


Write a python3 program to perform these actions:
    1.  use int(sys.argv[1]) as the arg to random.seed()
    2.  use int(sys.argv[2]) as the number of 3D points
    3.  generate a list of the random 3D points (after setting seed)
    4.  via cffi, invoke:
            double *compute_distances(int numpts, struct point *points)
        compiled from p5compdists.c into libp5.so
    5.  print the minimum distance using
        format .12f to get up to 12 digits after the decimal

You may assume that libp5.so can be loaded as: ./libp5.so
In other words, a copy of libp5.so will be in the dir where your
program is run.

Sample run:

    python3.7 p5.py 11 7000

and sample output:

    0.001152797993

That run would probably take about 5 seconds on system64,
whereas p5pure.py (pure python) takes around 20 seconds.

cffi docs:
    https://cffi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/
    https://cffi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/using.html

Use turnin to submit only your python source file.

The program will be graded on system64 using the python3.7 command.
