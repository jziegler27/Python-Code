turnin code:  py_p1


Write a python3.7 program that uses the dart-throwing algorithm to compute pi.
Count points on the circle as being inside the circle.

I will run the program on system64 this way:

    python3.7 yourpgmname  N

where N is the number of darts to throw.

Your pgm should print one line:

    pi estimate = xxxxx

where you replace xxxxx with the computed estimate of pi.


The program will be graded on system64 using the python3.7 command.

Use turnin to submit only your python source file.
