turnin code: py_p3

Write a python program that uses the python *generator* facility to
provide a series of prime numbers between the 1st and 2nd cmd-line args.
You should name the generator 'primes' and invoke it from your mainline
pgm like this:

    for prime in primes(int(sys.argv[1]),int(sys.argv[2])):
        print(prime)

There is a sample C pgm for checking prime-ness in:
    ~rbutler/public/courses/EXAMPLE.MAKE/prime.c

I will run your pgm as follows, with various values replacing the integer
arguments, e.g.:

    python3.7 ./script_name  99 1111

All you need to turnin is the python script.
